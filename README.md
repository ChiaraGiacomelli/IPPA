Interactive Polysome Profile Analyser

This Shiny app has been created to read in csv files from BioComp Gradient Fractionators and calculate the area under the curve of polysome profiles to do monosome to polysome (or subpolysome to polysome) ratios.

The basis of this shiny app is a function written by Joseph Waldron, currently Associate Scientist in the lab of Martin Bushell at CRUK Scotland Institute.
